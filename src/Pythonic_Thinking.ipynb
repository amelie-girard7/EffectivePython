    "## Whitespace Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the role of whitespace is crucial for syntax and readability. Python developers place high importance on the impact of whitespace for code clarity. Here are some best practices regarding whitespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use spaces over tabs for indentation.\n",
    "- Employ four spaces for each level of meaningful indentation.\n",
    "- Limit lines to 79 characters or fewer.\n",
    "- For line continuations, add an extra four spaces to the regular indentation level.\n",
    "- Separate functions and classes by two blank lines in a file.\n",
    "- Within a class, maintain a single blank line between methods.\n",
    "- In dictionaries, avoid whitespace between keys and colons, and place a single space before the value if it's on the same line.\n",
    "- Use a single space before and after the equals sign in variable assignments.\n",
    "- For type annotations, keep the variable name adjacent to the colon, followed by a space before the type specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming\n",
    "PEP 8 provides specific naming conventions for various elements in Python to enhance code readability. Adhere to the following naming guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For functions, variables, and attributes, use `lowercase_underscore` naming.\n",
    "- Protected instance attributes should follow the `_leading_underscore` format.\n",
    "- Private instance attributes should adopt the `__double_leading_underscore` format.\n",
    "- Classes and exceptions should use `CapitalizedWord` naming.\n",
    "- Module-level constants should be in `ALL_CAPS`.\n",
    "- In class instance methods, the first parameter should be named `self` to refer to the object itself.\n",
    "- In class methods, the first parameter should be named `cls` to refer to the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressions and Statements Guidelines\n",
    "The Zen of Python emphasizes having a single, clear way to achieve any task, and PEP 8 outlines this principle for expressions and statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opt for inline negation (`if a is not b`) over negating positive expressions (`if not a is b`).\n",
    "- To check for empty containers like `[]` or `''`, use `if not somelist` instead of comparing length to zero.\n",
    "- Conversely, `if somelist` is implicitly True for non-empty containers like `[1]` or `'hi'`.\n",
    "- Steer clear of single-line `if` statements, `for` and `while` loops, and `except` compound statements; expand them over multiple lines for better readability.\n",
    "- When an expression doesn't fit on a single line, enclose it in parentheses and add line breaks and indentation for enhanced clarity.\n",
    "- For multiline expressions, prefer using parentheses over the `\\` line continuation character.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "PEP 8 provides specific recommendations for importing modules and using them:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place all import statements, including `from x import y`, at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- Prefer absolute module names over relative names when importing. For instance, use `from bar import foo` instead of just `import foo` when within the `bar` package.\n",
    "- If relative imports are unavoidable, employ explicit syntax like `from . import foo`.\n",
    "- Arrange imports into three sections: standard library modules, third-party modules, and your own modules. Within each section, sort imports alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "The Pylint tool ([Pylint Website](https://www.pylint.org)) serves as a widely-used static analysis tool for Python code. It automates adherence to the PEP 8 guidelines and identifies a variety of common mistakes in Python applications. Numerous IDEs and text editors offer integrated linting capabilities or support comparable extensions."

    "Strings are ubiquitous in Python code, serving various purposes such as message rendering in UIs, command-line utilities, data writing to files and network sockets, specifying exception details, and aiding in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "String formatting is the technique of merging a predefined text template with variable data to create a single, comprehensible message stored as a string. Python offers four distinct methods for string formatting, integrated into the language and its standard library. Except for one method, which is discussed last in this section, the others have notable limitations that you should be aware of and steer clear of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%` operator is the most traditional method for string formatting in Python. In this approach, the template text is placed on the left side of the operator within a format string, and the data values to be inserted are provided on the right side, either as a single entity or a tuple containing multiple values. For instance, the `%` operator can be used to transform hard-to-understand binary and hexadecimal representations into strings of integers."

Python accommodates all standard `printf` options, including `%s`, `%x`, and `%f` format specifiers, along with control over aspects like decimal precision, padding, fill, and text alignment. Many programmers who are new to Python initially opt for C-style format strings due to their familiarity and ease of use.\n",
